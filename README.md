# IoT-Firmware

The folder consists of various Projects developed over the time during my course "ECEN 5823 IoT Embedded Firmware" at University of Colorado, Boulder. #foreverbuff #gobuffs

Special credits to Prof. Keith Graham for teaching this wonderful subject and teaching the concepts of IoT Firmware and Bluetooth technology especially BLE and Bluetooth Mesh.
I loved the way Prof. showed urgency in including the just launched and very new Bluetooth Mesh technology into the coursework. This shows his dedication towards the development of engineering students like us keeping us upto date with the latest tech.

Note: There are some Licence mentions in the Code for the software IP of Silicon Labs.
